                            Sometimes you think, What a small world. I recently experienced it again. I was just looking at a Facebookgroup about handlettering, one with more than 15.000 members and then I saw the most beautiful designs. I immediately thought: This is something that totally fits in my shop! A few days later, another design passed by which I totally loved. I realised the same person had posted that photo and I decided to send her a PM. And suddenly we found out we live really close to each other. And she even is the cousine of my hairdresser. What I said, it's a small world.
                            The good news is, she answered my message and would love to design for the shop! Also she will be responsible for the Freebie Friday, how cool is that? We thought it would be good to introduce her to all of you, so here she is:
